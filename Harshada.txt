A web-based framework (AgriSuit) that integrates various global data from different sources for
multi-criteria based agricultural land suitability assessment based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform is developed and presented. The platform enables online data gathering, training and classifying of
land cover classes based on remote sensing and GIS techniques, as well as computation of suitability of
land-use classes for agricultural activities. A demonstration of the framework on the Upper Blue Nile
basin in Ethiopia is presented.
